# User Manual for Microscope-Web - Backend

You will find here my end of training project. I worked on the backend side of it and it works well. You will find the frontend app too but it doesn't work as expected. I will do myself the frontend app in a near future.

You will find a detailed look at the project in the documentation folder (in french).

I have the authorization of Ben Robbins to develop this project.
